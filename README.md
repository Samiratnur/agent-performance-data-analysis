# Call Center Agent Performance Analysis with Python & Pandas

This project is a self-driven data analysis case study where I explored and analyzed call center performance data using Python and Pandas.

## 📊 Objective
To build a small end-to-end data pipeline that:
- Cleans and validates raw `.csv` data
- Merges multiple data sources
- Calculates meaningful metrics about agent performance

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel/CSV

## 📁 Files
- `dpdzero_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook containing all code and steps
- `dpdzero_summary_output.csv` – Final output summary with key metrics

## ✅ Metrics Calculated
- Total calls per agent
- Number of connected calls
- Average call duration
- Presence flag based on login activity

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Real-world data cleaning using Pandas
- Handling missing values and date formats
- Joining multiple datasets
- Grouping and aggregating performance metrics
- Exporting clean results to CSV
